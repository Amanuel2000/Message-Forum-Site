        A Passionate about techs.What inspired me to do the project... This project
        is inspiring because this is how people are going to interact wth each other
        and reflect their ideas about it. I have been meaning to do this project
        long time ago. Forums nowadays have a problem of being too massive with
        different sub forums with different topics that it has gotten hard to use
        especially the famous ones. Social media forums also have a grouping system
        that puts similar people with similar opinions on the same group which
        creates echo chambers where only similar opinions between the groups are
        shared, which is not a good way of discussion since discussion is very
        useful when different opinions communicate with each other. On this paper
        the final outcome of the project creates a forum site that is specific to a
        certain topic and there are no groupings that create echo chambers. The site
        tries to help on the mentioned problems by being useful to communicate
        openly with different idea people and to have a shared understandable
        knowledge between the different groups.
